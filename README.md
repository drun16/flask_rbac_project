## Description

This project is a boilerplate Flask application that provides a solid foundation for building web applications that require user management. It includes user registration, login/logout, password hashing, and role management ('User' and 'Admin'). The admin dashboard, built with Flask-Admin, allows administrators to perform CRUD operations on users and roles.

---

## Features

* **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout.
* **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plaintext, using Bcrypt for strong hashing.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Two user roles (`User` and `Admin`) with protected routes.
* **Admin Dashboard**: A full-featured admin panel (`/admin`) for managing users and roles.
* **Database Migrations**: Uses Flask-Migrate to handle database schema changes.
* **Automated Tests**: Includes a suite of tests written with `pytest`.

---

## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Flask
* **Database**: Flask-SQLAlchemy (defaults to SQLite, configurable for production)
* **Authentication**: Flask-Login
* **Admin Interface**: Flask-Admin
* **Password Hashing**: Flask-Bcrypt
* **Forms**: Flask-WTF
* **Database Migrations**: Flask-Migrate
* **Testing**: Pytest
